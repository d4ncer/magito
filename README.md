# Magito - Emacs as a git client

Still early days, much more to come:
* ~`git-timemachine` functionality + hydra~
* ~`git-blame` hydra~
* Basic hydra for common git client workflows
* Customisation options

## Usage

**Install**

```shell
git clone git@github.com:d4ncer/magito.git
cd ~/bin
ln -s /path/you/cloned/magito/magito magito
``` 

**Use**

```shell
cd some-git-project
magito
```

Useful commands can be found on the `SPC` leader key.

- Heavily inspired by [smagit](https://github.com/maio/smagit) by @maio.
- None of this would have been possible without the great work of @tarsius & co on [magit](https://github.com/magit/magit/).
